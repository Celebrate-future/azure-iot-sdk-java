/**
 * <p>
 * The public-facing API. Allows a single logical or physical device to connect
 * to an IoT Hub. The IoT Hub client supports sending events to and receiving
 * messages from an IoT Hub.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To support these workflows, the client library will provide the following
 * abstractions: a message, with its payload and associated properties; and a
 * client, which sends and receives messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The client buffers messages while the network is down, and re-sends them when
 * the network comes back online. It also batches messages to improve
 * communication efficiency (HTTPS only).
 * </p>
 * The client supports HTTPS 1.1 and AMQPS 1.0 transports.
